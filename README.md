# MIPS-Processor
▪ Developed a MIPS-based processor in Verilog, incorporating instruction fetch, register file, ALU, and a control unit for control operations. ▪ Employed a 5-stage pipelining technique for enhanced performance. ▪ Programmed the processor in Verilog to execute specific instructions and simulated using Vivado-Xilinx
